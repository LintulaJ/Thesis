# Thesis

## Getting started

Install DeepXDE and its requirements in the same folder as this project. The githash we used is 9729318cd548c2b387dc467227074f366a3633e3. Also Seaborn and sympy may be required to run some files. DeepXDE backend can be set using the DeepXDE set_backend command, we used Tensorflow V1.


## Code refactoring required

The code mostly came from playing around so the quality is sub-standard. To improve the code quality. One should

1. Improve variable positioning and naming.
2. Separate neural network training and analysis - store the network in a separate file so it can be used for analysis without retraining.
3. Add requirements to repo
4. Add some folder structure...

## Ideas for graphs

1. Make tolerances a silder
2. Do heatmaps from residuals
